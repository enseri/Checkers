        Notes:
            The king checker or checker that can move both forward and backward will
            automatically be put on you piece once you have reached your opponents side.

            The window size may need to be adjusted depending on the size of your monitor -- Example
            My Screen:
            WIDTH = 50 * line;
            HEIGHT = 50 * line;
            Yours(potentially):
            WIDTH = 52 * line;
            HEIGHT = 54 * line;
            simply go into the game and adjust the size of screen with your mouse cursor either by pulling a corner or a side.

            The console will alert you of whos the winner after each game has ended
            5 seconds after the alert the game will be reset automatically.
